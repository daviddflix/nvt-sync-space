# Development Roadmap

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Jest)
- **Domain Logic:** Entity validation, business rule enforcement
- **Value Object Validations:** Input sanitization, constraint checking  
- **Repository Stubs:** Interface compliance, data transformation
- **Service Logic:** Use case orchestration, error handling

### Integration Tests (Supertest + Test DB)
- **End-to-End Flows:** Complete user journeys against running Postgres container
- **API Contract Testing:** Request/response validation, status codes
- **Database Integration:** Migration execution, data persistence
- **WebSocket Testing:** Real-time message delivery

### Test Database Setup
- **Dockerized Postgres:** Test instance spun up before integration suite
- **Automatic Migrations:** Schema setup runs automatically per test suite
- **Data Isolation:** Each test suite uses fresh database state
- **Teardown:** Clean database state between test runs

### Coverage Goals
- **≥ 90% coverage** on domain and application layers
- **Integration coverage** for all API endpoints
- **WebSocket event testing** for real-time features

## Development Phases

- Database seeding system with default data
- Auth & User Context implementation
- User registration and login flows
- JWT token lifecycle
- Basic test foundation

**Success Criteria:**
- Default admin user and organization seeded
- Users can register and authenticate
- JWT tokens working
- Test suite running in Docker

### Sprint 2: Organization Management (Weeks 3-4)  
**Goals:** Workspace creation and membership

**Deliverables:**
- Organization Context implementation
- User-organization relationships
- Basic role management (admin/member)
- Organization CRUD operations
- Seed default organization with admin membership

**Success Criteria:**
- Default organization accessible to admin user
- Organizations can be created
- User membership working
- Admin role permissions functional

### Sprint 3: Real-Time Chat (Weeks 5-6)
**Goals:** Messaging with WebSocket integration

**Deliverables:**
- Chat Context implementation

- Real-time messaging functional
- Public/private channels working
- WebSocket events delivered
- Message reactions working

### Sprint 4: Project Management (Weeks 7-8)
**Goals:** Kanban boards and issue tracking

**Deliverables:**
- Project Context implementation
- Board creation with fixed columns (Backlog, In Progress, Done)
- Issue lifecycle management
- Issue comments
- Issue movement between columns
- Seed default board ("Getting Started") with sample issues

**Success Criteria:**
- Default board with sample workflow available
- Boards can be created with issues
- Issue status transitions working
- Comments functional

### Sprint 5: Attachments & Notifications (Weeks 9-10)
**Goals:** File handling and user alerts

**Deliverables:**
- Attachment Context implementation
- File upload (local storage)
- File size/type validation
- Notification Context
- Basic notification system

**Success Criteria:**
- Files can be uploaded and attached
- File restrictions enforced
- Notifications working

### Sprint 6: Testing & Polish (Weeks 11-12)
**Goals:** Production readiness

**Deliverables:**
- Complete test suite with ≥90% coverage
- Docker Compose optimization
- Basic API documentation
- Security review

**Success Criteria:**
- All tests passing with high coverage
- Docker deployment ready
- MVP features complete

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Real-time WebSocket implementation**
- **File upload and storage**

### Medium Risk  
- **Database migrations in Docker**
- **JWT token refresh mechanics**

### Low Risk
- **Basic CRUD operations**
- **Domain model implementation**

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Test coverage ≥ 90%
- All MVP features working
- WebSocket real-time messaging functional

### Business Metrics
- User registration/login working
- Organizations and channels functional
- Real-time chat operational
- Basic project management working

## Development Best Practices

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier configured
- Code review for all changes

### Testing Approach
- Test-driven development for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- WebSocket event testing
- Docker test database setup

### Deployment Strategy
- Docker-first development
- Simple .env configuration
- Automatic migrations on startup
